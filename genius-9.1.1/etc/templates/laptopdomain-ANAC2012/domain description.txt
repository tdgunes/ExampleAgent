This domain is a slight variation of the laptop domain from the qualification rounds. Two parties, a seller and a buyer, are negotiating the specifications of a laptop. The domain has three issues:

- The standard laptop brand
- The size of the hard disk
- The size of the external monitor

Each issue has only three options, making it a very small domain of 27 possible bids.

For example, in a negotiation about buying a laptop the buyer may prefer to have
a middle-sized screen but the seller may prefer to sell laptops with small
screens because s/he has more of those in stock. They could, however, agree on
the brand of laptop that they want to buy/sell. An outcome of a negotiation
reconciles such differences and results in a purchase.
